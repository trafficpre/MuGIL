MuGIL: A Multi-Graph Interaction Learning Network for Multi-Task Traffic Prediction

* A multi-graph interaction learning network is proposed for enhancing traffic prediction accuracy across heterogeneous variables and regions.
  
* A multi-source graph representation module is introduced for aligning heterogeneous information through semantic graphs.

* This paper designs a novel graph message-passing mechanism tailored for multi-task interaction, improving predictive accuracy and model effectiveness.
  
* We integrate a new benchmark dataset from four existing open-source datasets for multi-task traffic prediction.

We construct a benchmark for multi-task traffic prediction, which consists of four real-world datasets collected by the California Deportment of Transportation. From a temporal perspective, all of them contain about two months period traffic flow data and the time window is five minutes. Correspondingly, from a spatial perspective, this data is sourced from different regions within the state of California. Additionally, the geographical information of each region is provided to establish the topological relationship between different traffic observation stations.


# Continue to update:
(1) We have made targeted improvements to libMTL, necessitating the generation of a new package for use within this project.

(2) We will provide detailed explanations of key parameters in the code, along with accompanying examples.
